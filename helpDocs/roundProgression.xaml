        Each player starts with 13 tiles and gets assigned a wind, this decides where each player is seated.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        Starting from the dealer (the player with starting wind) each player draws a tile then discards a tile.
        <LineBreak/>
        This is repeated by the next player going in anticlockwise direction (East, North, West, South).
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        This process continues until any of the disruptions described in the "Disruption to rounds" section happens.
