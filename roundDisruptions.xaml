            Taking a tile:

        <LineBreak/>
        At any point if a player can form a Pong (3 identity tiles) or a Kong (4 identity tiles), that player can take the discarded tile and wall the relevant tiles. If a Kong is formed the player would
        draw another tile before proceeding.

        <LineBreak/>
        If the next player can form a Chow (3 consecutive tiles), that player can take the discared tile and wall the relevant tiles. Forming a Pong or Kong has priority over this.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        The round would proceed by the player discarding a tile.

        When a player draws a bonus tile (seasons or flowers), the tile is put to the side and another tile would be drawn, repeating if another bonus tile is drawn.
